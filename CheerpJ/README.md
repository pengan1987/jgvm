# How to convert JAR to JS
Compile the GVmakerSE project with Java 1.8 and the `GVmakerSE\dist\GVmakerSE.jar` file will be generated  

Use `cheerpjfy.py` provided by CheerpJ to generate `GVmakerSE.jar.js` file, check the `makeWASM.bat` script for a example running on Windows

The `example.html` is an fully working example file to show how to run it in browser, with libraries preload and game autoload function.
